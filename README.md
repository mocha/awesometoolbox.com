#Awesometoolbox

##Todos:

###User auth system
Possibly http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Login/ ?

###Toolboxes

###Basic search

###Edit tool page

###Comment system

###Fix category context processor
Seems to me like the best way to approach this would be to have a table of all categories that gets updated when a new tool is added or deleted. Then you could just pull from that table instead of having to do all the bs.
