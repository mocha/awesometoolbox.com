#TODO:

##User auth system

##Toolboxes

##Basic search

##Edit tool page

##Fix category context processor
Seems to me like the best way to approach this would be to have a table of all categories that gets updated when a new tool is added or deleted. Then you could just pull from that table instead of having to do all the bs.
